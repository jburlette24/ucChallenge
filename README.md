# ucChallenge
This project solves the following problem:

Given an integer array of length _n_ and an integer target, find the three integers in the array whose sum
is closest to the target.

## Rules

* Return the sum of the three integers.
* You may assume that each input array would have exactly one solution.
* Tests should be included.
```cs
public int SumThreeClosest(int[] numbers, int target) {
}
```
## Example
### Input: 
numbers = [-1, 2, 1, -4]
target = 1
### Output
2

### Explanation
The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1= 2).

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Microsoft Visual Studio
* .NET Core 3.1
* NUnit

### Installing
* clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/jburlette24/ucChallenge.git`
* open UtilityCloudChallenge.sln using Visual Studio 2019 or later

### How to Use this Program

The sample problem is hardcoded into program.cs. The user can replace the sample array and target with any array and target.

See the Sumfinder.Test project for additional test cases
